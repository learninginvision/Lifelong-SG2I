In this context, you are expected to generate specific coordinate box locations for objects in a scene graph, the size of each subject should at least about 1/5 of the whole picture, the length and width of the coordinate box should be as consistent as possible, alse coordinate box needs to have no overlap, considering their relative sizes and positions and the numbers of objects, and also give what kind of background the whole scene is possible in.
